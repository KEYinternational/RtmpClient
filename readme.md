## What’s project?
This project is treating rtmp streaming. Modern Windows, what is called Metro, can use rtmp video/audio streaming. You can use rtmp streaming easily.

## API reference for RtmpClient.
If you know these in detail, you check “[Document](./Document/)” folder. However, this file is not latest!

## Beta version Phase I
This component is debugged with Windows 8.1. However, implementation of error or exit transaction is not completed.

Thus, this component sometimes changes API endpoints.

## TODO
- rtmps/rtmpt streaming handle
- SharedObject handle
- more useful, just like callback assigns parameter.
- and so on…
